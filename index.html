    <div class="solutions"> 
        <h2> A few solutions :</h2>
         
    <h3>Psychiatric support</h3> 
            <p>People who are suffering from mental health problems should get support from psychiatrists in order to be able to overcome or at least reduce their mental problems. 
            Hence, in every health insurance worldwide, people should have the right to get mental support from psychiatrists or psychologists in case they need it.
            </p>

    <h3>Medical treatment</h3>
            <p>Many mental health problems also have to be treated with certain drugs in order to minimize symptoms.
              Depending on the mental problem and the overall state of the patient, doctors should prescribe medicine against mental illness.
              However, also drugs that are designed to fight mental health issues may have severe side effects and may even exacerbate the mental problems of patients. 
              Thus, these drugs should be prescribed with great care and on an individual basis in order to avoid making things even worse for patients.
            </p> 

    <h3>Reintegration of homeless persons into society</h3>
            <p>Since homelessness can also contribute to the development of mental illness, we should introduce programs that aim to reintegrate homeless persons into our society.
            Many homeless people actually want to have their old life back, however, they are often overwhelmed by their problems and don‚Äôt know where to start.
            By supporting them and giving them a clear plan on how to get back into normal life, they may also get back their hope and fight for a better future.
            </p>
    
    <h3>Fight discrimination</h3>
            <p>Discrimination is a big global issue and contributes to a variety of problems, including the development of mental health issues.
            Governments and celebrities across the world have to take a stand in order to decrease the level of inequality and to increase the level of freedom of people.By doing so,
            the overall acceptance for discriminated minorities will increase in our society and the level of discrimination will be lowered due to that.</p>

    <h3>Fight bullying</h3>
            <p>We as a society should also try to fight bullying. Victims of bullying may suffer from severe mental issues.
             Thus, whenever you see kids bullying someone, take a stand against it!
             By doing so, we can eradicate bullying in our society step by step.</p>

    <h3>Support children who had a tough childhood</h3>
            <p>Children who had been abused by their parents or other families or had a tough childhood for other reasons are often traumatized.
            These children need special support from psychologists so that they are able to overcome their trauma.
            </p>

    <h3>Reduce unemployment</h3>
            <p>Since many people fall into depression due to unemployment, it is also crucial to reduce unemployment rates when it comes to fighting mental health issues.
            Therefore, governments in regions with high unemployment rates may introduce financial incentives for firms to open branches in those regions.
            These financial incentives can come in the form of tax advantages or other financial subsidies.
            By doing so, firms have a bigger incentive to open branches and unemployment rates are likely to decrease due to that.
           </p>
    <h3>Psychological support in case of strokes of fate</h3>
           <p>A series of horrible events can lead to mental issues for some people.
           Those people often need psychological assistance in order to be able to process what happened to them.
           Thus, basic health insurance should also include the consultation of a psychologist in case of such strokes of fate happen.</p>

    <h3>Increase the level of tolerance in our society</h3>
           <p>We also have to increase the level of tolerance in our society.
           Although many politicians and many people claim to be tolerant, their actions do not match their words at all.
           This is especially true when it comes to minorities or other people who do not share the same cultural values.
           We should increase our level of tolerance towards minorities significantly in order to integrate them into society.
           Only then will those people feel as valuable members of society and fewer people will suffer from mental problems.</p>

    <h3>Build self-esteem</h3>
            <p>If you suffer from mental illness, one step to fight it is to build self-esteem.
           Self-esteem is crucial in life for success since if you are confident, you will master hard situations in life much easier compared to people who always struggle with themselves.
           Thus, in order to improve your level of self-esteem, join groups who share the same view on life.
           You can also join sports clubs or do activities on your own.
           Once you find the courage to go out and do things, you will be surprised how easy your self-esteem will increase and your mental issues may vanish due to that.</p>

    <h3>Ignore social pressure</h3>
                <p>Many people in our nowadays society also feel what is called ‚Äúsocial pressure‚Äù.
                People feel the need to oblige to social norms and cultural values.
                However, this compliance with cultural values often leads to high levels of unhappiness since people are not free to do what they actually want.
                Thus, instead of complying with social norms, try to form your own character and act according to that.
                You will be surprised how much better you will feel by ignoring social values and do whatever you want.</p>

    <h3>Raise awareness on this topic</h3>
                <p>Many people are still not aware that mental disorders are a big problem in our society.
                 Thus, you should raise awareness on this topic so that parents take care of their children and can react in case they detect mental problems.
                </p>

    <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>Education is crucial to fight several kinds of problems.
                  This is also true when it comes to fighting mental illness.
                  Thus, children as well as grownups should be taught about mental health issues so that they can take measures to avoid the development of those issues.
                </p>
